Reduces max jump distance for all zombies to 0 and disables ladder climbing for zombies.

NOTE: Zombies will still jump over obstacles as usual but it stops them from making large gap leaps. In some instances a zombie may jump a 3 block gap, but I tested with 75 zombies, 25 of them runners, and it did not happen too often (may be due to their hard coded obstacle jumping). Heck sometimes a one block gap works just fine.
